Role / Domain: General and Operations Manager (online gaming platform operations)  

Context I am the Operations Manager for an online chess platform. We are seeing inconsistent player experience across time controls (abort spikes, timeouts, and unusually short games), and leadership needs a single, auditable “ops scorecard” to decide where to focus matchmaking tuning and anti-abuse review.  

Input Use ONLY the attached dataset: Chess Game Dataset (Lichess) CSV (one row per game). 

Use the original column names.  

Primary Goal (close-ended) 

Produce an “Operations Scorecard” that quantifies match quality and engagement by time-control segment and rated status, and clearly surfaces the worst-performing segments for intervention.  

Deliverables (NO XLSX/CSV outputs) 

Return a ZIP file named: Chess_Ops_Scorecard_Pack.zip containing exactly two files:  

1) Chess_Ops_Scorecard.pdf A management-ready PDF with the following tables (grid borders, consistent number formatting):  

Table A — Executive KPIs (overall, whole dataset) 

- Total games 

- % Rated games 

- Avg turns per game (1 decimal) 

- Avg game duration (minutes, 1 decimal) if start/end timestamps exist; otherwise omit duration and include a note 

- Outcome mix: % White win, % Black win, % Draw (1 decimal, percent) 

- % Aborted (1 decimal, percent) based on game status indicating abort 

- % Timeout (1 decimal, percent) based on game status indicating timeout  

Table B — Segment Summary (one row per segment) 

Define “segment” as: 

(Time Control Category) × (Rated Status) 

Time Control Category rules: 

- If the dataset contains an explicit time-control field (e.g., “TimeControl” like “600+0”, “300+5”, etc.), categorize by initial time:   

Bullet: < 180s   

Blitz: 180–479s   

Rapid: 480–1499s   

Classical: >= 1500s 

- If no time-control field exists, categorize using observed game duration (minutes):   

Bullet: < 3   

Blitz: 3–7.9   

Rapid: 8–24.9   

Classical: >= 25 

Rated Status: use the dataset’s rated indicator.  

For each segment row, include: 

- Games (count) 

- Avg turns (1 decimal) 

- Outcome mix: % White win, % Black win, % Draw (1 decimal) 

- % Aborted (1 decimal) 

- % Timeout (1 decimal) 

- “Quality Flags” column with TRUE/FALSE for:   

Flag_AbortSpike: 

segment abort % >= (overall abort % + 5.0 percentage points)   Flag_TimeoutSpike: 

segment timeout % >= (overall timeout % + 3.0 percentage points)  

Sort Table B by (Abort % desc, then Timeout % desc, then Games desc).  

Table C — “Intervention List” (Top 5) 

Show the 5 segments with the highest combined disruption index: Disruption Index = (Abort % * 0.6) + (Timeout % * 0.4) Include: 

- Time Control Category 

- Rated Status 

- Games 

- Abort % 

- Timeout % 

- Disruption Index (1 decimal) 

Add a short, ops-oriented note for each row (one sentence) describing the likely operational follow-up (e.g., matchmaking tuning review, anti-abuse sampling, time-control specific UX friction check). Do not give generic advice—tie it to the metrics.  

2) Spreadsheet_Blueprint.docx 

A DOCX “build spec” that makes the scorecard reproducible in a spreadsheet later. It must include: 

- Data Prep: the exact derived columns you created (names + logic), written in spreadsheet-style formulas where possible (e.g., duration minutes from timestamps; outcome label; abort/timeout flags; segment keys). 

- Segment Summary: the aggregation definitions (COUNTIFS/AVERAGEIFS-style descriptions) matching Tables A–C. 

- Data quality handling rules (e.g., what you did if duration fields are missing).  

Constraints / Quality Bar 

- Use the dataset’s professional vocabulary (abort rate, timeout incidence, outcome distribution, segment exposure). 

- Do not over-explain basic terms (assume a colleague reader). 

- The PDF tables must be internally consistent: segment totals should reconcile to the overall totals. 

- No extra files in the ZIP. No XLSX. No CSV output.
